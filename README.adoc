= TTGO LoRa Temperature Sensor

This example uses a TTGO LoRa32 V1 board with a Semtech SX1276 LoRa transceiver
and an onboard OLED display to demonstrate how to connect a DHT22 temperature
and relative humidity sensor to a LoRaWAN network (The Things Network, for example).

== Setup

=== DHT22 and LoRa antenna

* The signal pin of the DHT22 must be connect to pin 13. 
    This pin can be changed by adjusting the value of the macro `DHTPIN`.
* The VDD pin of the DHT22 must be connected to 3.3V power supply (the pin named "3.3").
* The GND pin of the DHT22 must be connected to the GND on the board.

WARNING: Make sure that the LoRa antenna is connected to the board before powering it on.
The board can be damaged if the antenna is not connected when powered on!

=== PlatformIO and Visual Studio Code

This project uses https://platformio.org/[PlatformIO] as development environment. It is available
as a https://platformio.org/platformio-ide[extension for Visual Studio Code].

Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code with an activated PlatformIO extension
and you should be able to build and flash the project onto a connected TTGO LoRa32 board.

=== Configuration

Copy the file `include/config_template.h` to `include/config.h`.
Adjust the values for APPEUI, DEVEUI, and APPKEY according to the settings required for your 
LoRaWAN network (e.g. the values provided by The Things Network). Note that the order/endianess of the
bytes is important (little and big endian).

== Display

The display shows status information about the current state of the LoRa stack.

On the left, it shows the current state (transmitting, idling, ...) below the heading.
Below that, the current temperature and humidity are shown.

On the right, different statsu information about the current LoRa connection are shown. For details
refere to the following table.

.Status information on display
|====
| T: | Temperature in degree Celsius
| H: | Relative humidity in %
| ADR | If on, the _adaptive data rate_ (ADR) is switched on, else off
| DR | _Data rate_, between 0 (slowest, most reliable) and 6 (fastest, least reliable); valid for EU868
| SF | _Spread factor_, between 7 (least spread, faster transmission) and 12 (widest spread, slower transmission)
| BW | _Band width_ in kHz, either 125kHz or 250 kHz
| TC | _Transmit counter_, number of messages transmitted
| RC | _Receive counter_, number of messages received
| R | _Received signal strength indicator_ (RSSI), indicates the signal strength of a received messages; the higher the better
| S | _Signal to noise ratio_ (SNR) in dB, the higher the value, the better the signal can be differentiated from the noise
